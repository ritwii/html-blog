<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Welcome to my website! I'm Ritwika Dewan, a biotechnology post-graduate with a
  passion for both science and technology. My major project focused on
  "Development and Evaluation of Analytical Testing Methods for Tetanus and
  Diphtheria Combination Vaccine: Advancements in Quality Control and
  Assurance."

  Beyond the laboratory, I have developed a passion for web development. This
  new interest allows me to blend my analytical mindset with a creative approach
  to technology, opening up exciting possibilities for innovation. As I continue
  to grow in my biotechnology career, I'm also learning to build and design
  websites, bridging the gap between science and digital solutions.

  My journey is a testament to my curiosity and drive to learn and adapt in a
  rapidly evolving world. Whether it's in the lab or behind a computer screen,
  I'm dedicated to making a positive impact through my work. Thank you for
